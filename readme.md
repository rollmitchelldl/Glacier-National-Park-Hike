#Glacier National Park Hike
####*Ptarmigan Tunnel & Icerberg Lake Trails*

This web map is a trail map of two combined trails in the Many Glacier area of Glacier National Park in Montana. The hike starts at the Iceberg and Ptarmigan Trailhead. About two miles in you can either go left towards Iceberg Lake or take a right and head for the Ptarmigan Tunnel.

The information about the description of the trails are provided by [All Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/montana/ptarmigan-tunnel--4?ref=result-card)

To make this web map, [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Iceberg+Lake,+Montana+59417/Ptarmigan+Tunnel,+Montana+59928/@48.8341751,-113.7847502,11.94z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x5368ad090083ea09:0x4f1a7ecb1430881d!2m2!1d-113.7480259!2d48.8120134!3m4!1m2!1d-113.7114631!2d48.8204195!3s0x5368b27834600a63:0x5f6fff7b5271906c!1m5!1m1!1s0x5368b2b98ec0dcc1:0x2d497b9e673624dd!2m2!1d-113.7077105!2d48.8496413!3e2) was used to get a base data route for the hike. [Maps to GPX](https://mapstogpx.com/) was then used to convert the google maps data into a gpx file. [GeoJson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) was then used to convert the gpx data file into a geojson file which was then used to make the web map of the hiking trail.
